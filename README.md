# netsysAgent

NetSysAgent (NSA) is a poor man's Network System Administration Kit. It works in:
+ Controling users and groups on all the network computers.
+ Collection system state, information and services to a central portal.
+ Assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers.
+ Updates and patch releases to each computer registered on portal.
+ Controls security and remote access to the registered computer.

Its built around Active Directory System, but is lot easier to implement, easier to control and navigate and removes complications for network administrations. Overall this system works on Linux, Windows and Mac.

Currently we are developing a harvested system, which might take some time for our first release, but stay tuned.
